                                # Variables and thier write rules.

# That are the valide way of write the variables.

print("The name of student is ", name, "and his age is", age)
                                # Data types in python

# There are several data types in python, including:

#a = 3           # 1. Integers: whole numbers, like 1, 2, 3,
# b = 4.6         # 2. Floats: decimal numbers, like 3.14 or -0.5
# c= "Najam Ali"  # 3. Strings: sequences of characters, like "hello" or 'hello'
# d = True        # 4. Boolean: a logical value that can be either True or False
# e = None      # 5. None: a special value that represents the absence of a value
#Note "Variables do not need to be declared with any particular type, and can even change type after they have been set."
# Casting
# If you want to specify the data type of a variable, this can be done with casting.
# a = int(3)
# print (a)
# Variables rules
# if i want check the type of the operator i can use type() function
# print(type(a))
# rules to variables
        # 1: Variables must contain a valid variable name
        # 2: Variables must not start with a number
        # 3: Variables must not contain any spaces
        # 4: Variables must not contain any special characters except for underscores
        # 5: variable name not a reserved keyword.
