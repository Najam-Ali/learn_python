# List in the python

# In pyhton programing we use the list to store any type of data in a variable like a container.Its like a array in other programming language.Sting is not editable means no change in a existed string but in list the the value can be change at any index.

fruite = ["Apple", "Peach", 45, 78.7, False, "Ali", "Ahmed"]
# print(fruite[1])

fruite[1] = "Grapes" # It shows that the list are the muteable
# print(fruite[1])

# Here we see the some methods of list that similer to the string
# print(fruite[1:5])  # it return this ['Grapes', 45, 78.7, False] similer to the 

# Note In string when we aplly a function on a string it return a new value in result but In list change the original string with change means old list make a new list.
