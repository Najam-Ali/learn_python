# When we need this type of phenomena in which we create a container and put some differents elements of different data types and not muteable then we use the concept of the Touple.

# touple = ("Ali","Akbar",45,23,54,45,67,85) # Tuple look like this.

# print(type(touple)) # its show the type of list called touple.

old_tuple = () # it give the empty tuple and if we write a single ements in it i give a new data type not the tuple. Let take example:
#example_tuple = (2) # It return the int type of this even include in the form of the tuple.But here we have a question how we can write a sigle element in tuple.Let take an other example:
new_tuple = (3,) # It return the class type of the tuple.So its mean with this structure (element , ) use can create a tuple of a single element.The use o this " , " is to important in this situation. 
print(type(new_tuple))
