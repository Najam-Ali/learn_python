# Sets & Dectionary also the way to store the data in memory through the pyhton.

# => store the valuse with thier key value is called dictionary.

student = {
    "name" : "Ahmed",
    "marks" : "50%",
    "status" : "pass",
    "class" : "Matric"
}
# print(student)
# print(student["marks"]) # Its print the value againt this key.

# Rule of the python.

# 1: Dictionary is underordered.
# 2: It is immutable.
# 3: It is indexed.
# 4: one key is not use more then one time.
