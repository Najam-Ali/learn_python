# Write a program to find out whether a student has passed or failed if it requires a total of 40% at least 33% in each ssubject to pass.Assume 3 subjects and take marks as an input from user.

# sub1 = int(input("Enter marks of Subject 1: "))
# sub2 = int(input("Enter marks of Subject 2: "))
# sub3 = int(input("Enter marks of Subject 3: "))

# total = sub1 + sub2 + sub3
# percentage = (total / 300) * 100

# if sub1 >= 33 and sub2 >= 33 and sub3 >= 33 and percentage >= 40:
#     print("Congratulations! You have PASSED")
#     print("Your Percentage is:", percentage)
# else:
#     print("Sorry! You have FAILED")
#     print("Your Percentage is:", percentage)
